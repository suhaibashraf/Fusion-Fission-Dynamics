# Fusion-Fission Dynamics

## Robotics Project
Developed Netlogo and Thymio robotics projects as a part of coursework for the module Artificial Life with Robotics. The robot follows other robots, moves in flocks, senses obstructions or lines and avoids them.

By altering the values of some variables, the robots change their behaviours, such as following other robots in a line or walking in flocks.

### Technology Used
