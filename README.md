# Fusion-Fission Dynamics

## Robotics Project
Developed Netlogo and Thymio robotics projects as a part of coursework for the course Artificial Life with Robotics. The robot followed other robots, walk in flocks, detected the obstacles or line and avoided.

By changing the values of these variables, the robots changes their behaviour like following other robot in a line or walk in flocks.
