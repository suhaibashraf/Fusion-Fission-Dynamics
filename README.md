# Fusion-Fission Dynamics
__Fusion-Fission Dynamics__ represents a cutting-edge exploration into the realm of robotics and artificial life. This project, a cornerstone of the Artificial Life with Robotics module, showcases the sophisticated behavior of robots as they interact with their environment and each other. Utilizing advanced programming in Netlogo alongside the tangible mechanics of Thymio robots, this initiative highlights the delicate balance between individual autonomy and group dynamics in robotic systems.
## Robotics Project
The core of Fusion-Fission Dynamics lies in its ability to simulate complex behaviors among robots. These behaviors include:
* __Flocking:__ Robots move in harmony, emulating the natural dynamics seen in flocks of birds or schools of fish.
* __Obstacle Avoidance:__ Sensory inputs allow robots to detect and navigate around obstructions or follow designated paths, showcasing their potential for real-world applications.
* __Adaptive Behavior:__ By adjusting specific variables, robots can alter their behavior, transitioning between following in a line to moving in cohesive groups.
This project not only demonstrates technical prowess but also offers insights into the possibilities of robotic cooperation and adaptability, essential for the development of autonomous robotic systems.
